# JamAlert: Community Resilience Alert System - Requirements

## Introduction

JamAlert is a real-time, zero-cost, community-powered alert system that delivers hyper-local flood warnings with actionable guidance, crowdsourced ground intelligence, and multi-channel accessibility to save lives and protect livelihoods in Jamaica. The system addresses the critical gap in Jamaica's current fragmented flood alert system by providing timely, actionable, hyper-local warnings to the people most at risk.

2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL store the user information in the database AND send a confirmation email
3. WHEN a user selects their parish THEN the system SHALL only send alerts relevant to that specific parish
4. WHEN a user chooses alert preferences THEN the system SHALL respect their choice of SMS, email, or both notification channels
5. IF a user provides invalid data THEN the system SHALL display clear validation errors AND prevent form submission
6. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their alerts dashboard

### Requirement 2: Incident Reporting System

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an emergency alert is triggered THEN the system SHALL send notifications to all users in the affected parish within 30 seconds
2. WHEN weather conditions exceed predefined thresholds THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and distribute flood alerts
