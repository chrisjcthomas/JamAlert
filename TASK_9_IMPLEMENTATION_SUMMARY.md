# Task 9: Automated Weather Monitoring System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive automated weather monitoring system for the JamAlert platform that polls weather data every 15 minutes, checks thresholds, and triggers alerts when flood conditions are detected.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Weather Service (`backend/src/services/weather.service.ts`)
- **Multi-source weather data fetching**: Supports both Jamaica Meteorological Service API and OpenWeatherMap as fallback
- **Parish-specific monitoring**: Covers all 14 parishes in Jamaica with dedicated coordinates
- **Intelligent flood risk calculation**: Calculates flood risk levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME) based on rainfall and wind speed
- **Caching with TTL**: Stores weather data in MySQL with configurable expiration times
- **Threshold checking**: Compares current conditions against parish-specific thresholds
- **Alert generation**: Creates weather alerts when thresholds are exceeded
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Uses cached data when APIs fail, implements retry logic

### 2. Scheduled Weather Monitor Function (`backend/src/functions/weather-monitor.ts`)
- **Azure Functions timer trigger**: Runs every 15 minutes using cron expression `0 */15 * * * *`
- **Complete monitoring workflow**:
  1. Fetches weather data for all parishes
  2. Stores data in database with TTL
  3. Checks thresholds for violations
  4. Creates weather alerts for exceeded thresholds
  5. Cleans up expired data
- **Comprehensive logging**: Tracks execution metrics, errors, and performance
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure handling with detailed error reporting

### 3. Weather Thresholds Management (`backend/src/functions/weather-thresholds.ts`)
- **Admin API endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/admin/weather/thresholds` - Get thresholds for parishes
  - `PUT /api/admin/weather/thresholds` - Update parish thresholds
  - `GET /api/admin/weather/current` - Get current weather data
  - `POST /api/admin/weather/check` - Manual weather check trigger
- **Authentication**: Secured with admin JWT authentication
- **Input validation**: Uses Zod schemas for request validation
- **Audit logging**: Logs all admin actions for compliance

### 4. Database Schema Extensions
Enhanced the existing Prisma schema with weather-related tables:
- **WeatherData**: Stores current weather conditions with TTL
- **WeatherThreshold**: Parish-specific alert thresholds
- **WeatherAlert**: Records of triggered weather alerts

### 5. Configuration Integration
Extended the configuration system with weather-specific settings:
- API keys and URLs for weather services
- Threshold defaults (50mm rainfall, 60km/h wind)
- Cache TTL settings (15 minutes for weather data)
- Monitoring intervals and retry settings

## Key Features

### Multi-Source Weather Data
- **Primary**: Jamaica Meteorological Service API (when available)
- **Fallback**: OpenWeatherMap API with automatic failover
- **Cache**: MySQL-stored data as last resort (up to 2 hours old)

### Intelligent Flood Risk Assessment
```typescript
// Flood risk calculation based on conditions
if (rainfall >= 100 || windSpeed >= 120) return FloodRisk.EXTREME;
if (rainfall >= 75 || windSpeed >= 90) return FloodRisk.HIGH;
if (rainfall >= 50 || windSpeed >= 60) return FloodRisk.MEDIUM;
return FloodRisk.LOW;
```

### Parish Coverage
Complete coverage of all 14 Jamaican parishes:
- Kingston, St. Andrew, St. Thomas, Portland
- St. Mary, St. Ann, Trelawny, St. James
- Hanover, Westmoreland, St. Elizabeth
- Manchester, Clarendon, St. Catherine

### Alert Types and Severity
- **FLOOD_WARNING**: High severity for extreme rainfall
- **HEAVY_RAIN**: Medium severity for significant rainfall
- **HIGH_WINDS**: Medium/High severity for dangerous winds
- **SEVERE_WEATHER**: General severe weather conditions

### Performance Optimizations
- **Batch processing**: Handles all parishes in parallel
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient database connections
- **Caching strategy**: Reduces API calls and improves reliability
- **Cleanup automation**: Removes expired data automatically

## Testing Implementation

### 1. Weather Service Tests (`backend/src/services/__tests__/weather.service.test.ts`)
- **API integration testing**: Tests both Jamaica Met and OpenWeatherMap APIs
- **Fallback mechanism testing**: Verifies graceful degradation
- **Threshold checking logic**: Validates alert triggering conditions
- **Flood risk calculation**: Tests all risk level calculations
- **Cache functionality**: Tests data storage and retrieval
- **Error handling**: Tests various failure scenarios

### 2. Weather Monitor Function Tests (`backend/src/functions/__tests__/weather-monitor.test.ts`)
- **Successful execution flow**: Tests complete monitoring workflow
- **Error handling**: Tests various failure scenarios
- **Logging verification**: Ensures proper metrics collection
- **Performance monitoring**: Tests execution time tracking
- **Alert creation**: Verifies alert generation logic

### 3. Weather Thresholds API Tests (`backend/src/functions/__tests__/weather-thresholds.test.ts`)
- **Authentication testing**: Verifies admin-only access
- **CRUD operations**: Tests threshold management
- **Input validation**: Tests request validation
- **Manual trigger testing**: Tests emergency weather checks
- **Error scenarios**: Tests various failure conditions

## Integration Points

### Database Integration
- Seamless integration with existing Prisma schema
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Efficient indexing for performance

### Configuration System
- Extends existing config validation
- Environment-based settings
- Secure API key management

### Authentication System
- Reuses existing admin authentication
- JWT token validation
- Role-based access control

### Logging and Monitoring
- Integrates with Azure Application Insights
- Structured logging for analysis
- Performance metrics collection

## Deployment Considerations

### Azure Functions Configuration
```json
{
  "schedule": "0 */15 * * * *",
  "runOnStartup": false,
  "functionTimeout": "00:05:00"
}
```

### Environment Variables Required
```
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_key
JAMAICA_MET_API_URL=https://met.gov.jm/api (optional)
WEATHER_CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES=15
FLOOD_THRESHOLD_MM=50
WIND_THRESHOLD_KMH=60
WEATHER_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=900
```

### Database Migrations
The Prisma schema includes all necessary weather tables and will be created during deployment.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### System Health Monitoring
- API availability tracking
- Database connection monitoring
- Function execution success rates
- Alert delivery statistics

### Performance Metrics
- Weather data fetch times
- Threshold check execution time
- Alert creation latency
- Cache hit rates

### Error Alerting
- Failed weather API calls
- Database connection failures
- Threshold check errors
- Alert creation failures

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Considerations
- SMS alert integration for weather warnings
- Push notification support
- Advanced weather pattern analysis
- Machine learning for flood prediction
- Integration with ODPEM systems

### Scalability Improvements
- Redis caching for high-traffic scenarios
- Message queue for alert processing
- Horizontal scaling for multiple regions
- Advanced retry mechanisms
