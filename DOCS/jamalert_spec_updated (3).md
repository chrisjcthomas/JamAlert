# JamAlert: Community Resilience Alert System
## üèÜ Hackathon-Winning Project Specification

### üéØ The Story: Defining the Problem

**The Five Whys - Flood Alert Crisis in Jamaica:**

1. **Who is impacted?** 
   - Rural farmers like Grace who lose entire crops and livestock to flash floods
   - Urban commuters like Andre who face life-threatening road conditions during heavy rains
   - School principals like Mr. David responsible for 300+ children's safety
   - Elderly residents in flood-prone communities with limited mobility or tech access
   - Emergency responders who lack real-time ground intelligence

2. **What is the issue?**
   - Jamaica's current flood alert system is fragmented across multiple agencies (ODPEM, Met Service, media)
   - Alerts are too broad (parish-wide) when flooding is hyper-local (specific roads, gullies, communities)
   - No real-time feedback loop - authorities don't know actual ground conditions
   - Critical information doesn't reach vulnerable populations (rural areas, elderly, non-smartphone users)
   - Motorists receive no proactive warnings about dangerous road conditions until it's too late

3. **When does the problem manifest?**
   - During flash flood events (minutes to develop, requiring immediate action)
   - Heavy rainfall periods when urban drainage systems overflow
   - Hurricane and tropical storm seasons (June-November annually)
   - Rush hour commutes when roads are most congested and escape routes limited
   - School dismissal times when children are walking home through flood-prone areas

4. **Where in the community does the problem occur?**
   - Urban areas: Kingston, Spanish Town, Portmore - critical transportation corridors
   - Rural farming communities along river valleys (Yallahs, Rio Cobre, Black River)
   - School zones and residential areas in flood-prone parishes
   - Major highways and underpasses that become impassable during floods
   - Low-income communities with inadequate drainage infrastructure

5. **Why is it necessary to address the problem?**
   - **Life Safety**: Flash floods kill people who receive warnings too late or in wrong format
   - **Economic Impact**: Lost crops, damaged vehicles, missed work days, business disruptions
   - **Educational Disruption**: School closures, students trapped, unsafe walking routes
   - **Emergency Response Efficiency**: First responders need real-time ground truth to deploy resources effectively
   - **Community Resilience**: Climate change is intensifying flood frequency and severity - communities need better preparation tools

**Problem Statement**: Jamaica's flood alert system fails to provide timely, actionable, hyper-local warnings to the people most at risk, resulting in preventable deaths, economic losses, and community vulnerability during increasingly frequent flood events.

**Solution**: JamAlert ‚Äî a **real-time, zero-cost, community-powered alert system** that delivers hyper-local flood warnings with actionable guidance, crowdsourced ground intelligence, and multi-channel accessibility to save lives and protect livelihoods.

**Impact**: Reach thousands in seconds, prevent vehicle entrapments, enable proactive evacuations, and create a replicable model for Caribbean disaster preparedness.

**Why Now**: Climate change is intensifying floods ‚Üí immediate need for better alert systems.

**Why Us**: Student-built on free Azure tier ‚Üí **scalable, accessible, replicable** across developing regions.

**Are you able to measure the impact of your solution if it is successfully implemented?**

Yes, JamAlert is designed with comprehensive impact measurement capabilities built into its core architecture:

**Immediate Impact Metrics (Real-time tracking)**:
- Alert delivery rates and response times (tracked in alerts table)
- User registration growth by parish (demographics analysis)
- Crowdsourced incident reports vs official weather data correlation
- Alert validation feedback ratios (accurate/false alarm/resolved)
- Geographic coverage and penetration rates across vulnerable communities

**Life Safety Indicators**:
- Reduction in flood-related vehicle entrapments (partnership with emergency services data)
- Decreased emergency response times through better situational awareness
- Community preparedness surveys measuring behavioral changes
- School dismissal decision timing improvements (tracked via institutional partnerships)

**Economic Impact Assessment**:
- Agricultural loss reduction (collaboration with farming associations)
- Transportation disruption minimization (traffic flow analysis)
- Emergency service cost savings through proactive alerts
- Business continuity improvements during flood events

**Community Engagement Metrics**:
- Community champion effectiveness (adoption rates in their areas)
- Multi-generational usage patterns (elderly and youth engagement)
- Language preference usage (English/Patois/Spanish adoption)
- Accessibility feature utilization rates

**System Performance Indicators**:
- Network resilience during peak usage (Azure Application Insights)
- Multi-channel failover effectiveness
- Alert accuracy improvement over time through AI learning
- Cross-parish collaboration and data sharing effectiveness

**Long-term Resilience Outcomes**:

## üë• User Personas

To guide our development and focus on real-world needs, we are building JamAlert for people like:

**Grace, the St. Thomas Farmer**: Grace is a 45-year-old farmer with 10 acres near the Yallahs River. Her livelihood depends on her crops. A single flash flood can wipe out a year's income. She isn't very tech-savvy but always has her basic smartphone with her.

*Needs*: A simple, immediate alert (in English or Patois) that gives her a 30-60 minute window to move equipment and secure what she can. She needs a system that is free and requires no complex setup.

**Mr. David, the Clarendon School Principal**: David is the principal of a primary school with 300 students, many of whom walk home. He is responsible for their safety. National alerts are too broad, but he knows certain local gullies can flood quickly, cutting off routes home.

*Needs*: A hyper-local alert specific to his school's district so he can make an early decision to close school and ensure children get home safely before roads become impassable.

**Andre, the Kingston Commuter**: Andre is a 30-year-old IT specialist who drives from Portmore to his office in New Kingston daily. His route includes several known flood-prone hotspots. During heavy rainfall, he worries about getting stuck or, worse, caught in a flash flood. He needs immediate, street-specific alerts and safe alternate routes to navigate the city safely.

*Needs*: Real-time warnings about dangerous road conditions, proactive rerouting suggestions, and emergency assistance if trapped. Requires GPS-based location awareness and actionable guidance during active commutes.

## üó∫Ô∏è Competitive Landscape

While Jamaica has national-level alert systems, JamAlert fills a critical gap in hyper-local, accessible warnings.

**National Systems (ODPEM, Met Service)**: These agencies issue essential, broad-based warnings for entire parishes or the whole island. JamAlert complements, not competes, by taking this broad data and applying it to specific, local flood-prone areas.

**Social Media & Word-of-Mouth**: These are fast but often unreliable, prone to misinformation, and do not reach everyone. JamAlert provides a single, trusted, and verified source of information.

**Our Unique Value Proposition**: JamAlert is the only system designed to be hyper-local, automated, data-driven (with configurable thresholds), and completely free for any user to access, removing all barriers to safety.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

We have identified potential risks to the project's success and have planned mitigation strategies:

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Technical: Weather API Unreliability** | Medium | High | Use cached weather data (up to 2 hours old) during an outage and notify the admin. Maintain a secondary API source as a fallback for future phases. |
| **Adoption: Low Community Sign-ups** | Medium | High | **Multi-channel approach**: Partner with trusted community organizations like the Red Cross and parish councils. Deploy **community champions** with training workshops and small incentives. **Low-tech outreach**: Radio campaigns, posters in community centers, church announcements. **USSD fallback** for feature phone users (Phase 2). |
| **Resource: Exceeding Free Tier Limits** | Low | Medium | Implement active monitoring of Azure service usage (Function executions, database storage). Build alerts for when usage approaches 80% of the free limit. **Data pruning**: Archive alert_history monthly, compress old data. **Storage management**: Implement automatic cleanup of cached data older than 7 days. |
| **Operational: Alert Fatigue** | Medium | Medium | **Feedback analysis workflow**: Tag feedback as "false alarm", "missed flood", "timing issue". Feed data into threshold refinement. **User-configurable thresholds** in Phase 3. **Community validation**: Champions help identify false positives at local level. |
| **Technical: Notification Hubs Failure** | Low | High | **Fallback sequence**: Email ‚Üí Push ‚Üí retry_queue ‚Üí Manual admin notification. **Channel redundancy**: Store user communication preferences with backup channels. **Admin emergency override**: Manual notification dispatch if all automated channels fail. |

## Workflow Details

### Registration flow (public user):
1. User visits `/register`, fills form (name, parish, preferred contact channels, maybe threshold preferences).
2. Backend (Azure Function) validates input, stores record in MySQL.
3. Send a confirmation (email first, **Notification Hubs push notification** as backup) so user knows registration is successful.
4. **Error Handling**: If email fails ‚Üí retry 3 times, log for manual follow-up. No SMS available in Students Starter.

### Alert triggering / Notifications:
* **Data Sources**:
  - Primary: Jamaica Meteorological Service API for weather data
  - Secondary: Office of Disaster Preparedness alerts feed  
  - Backup: Manual admin override for emergency situations
* Scheduled Azure Function checks weather conditions every 15 minutes
* **Flood Type Differentiation**: System categorizes alerts based on threat type:
  - **Flash Flood** (‚ö°): "Move immediately, secure yourself and loved ones" - urgent, high-priority push
  - **Riverine Flood** (üåä): "Flooding risk in X hours, prepare equipment and livestock now" - early warning
  - **All Clear** (‚úÖ): "Flood threat has passed for [Parish]. Safe to resume normal activities"
* When threshold crossed, create alert records with **flood category flag** and **severity level**
* For each subscribed user in affected parish, send alert via **staggered parish-level batches** to prevent network congestion
* **Error Handling**: 
  - If weather API down ‚Üí use cached data (up to 30 minutes for critical alerts) + notify admin via email
  - If email service fails ‚Üí escalate to **Notification Hubs push notifications** for all users
  - **Network congestion mitigation**: Staggered sending, multi-channel fallback sequence
  - If all channels fail ‚Üí log incident and queue for manual processing

### Feedback flow:
* **Dual-Channel Feedback System**:
  1. **Incident Reporting** (`/report`): Public form to report new floods with location, severity, and photos. Submissions stored for admin review and map visualization with real-time pin updates.
  2. **Alert Validation**: After receiving an alert, users can provide structured feedback via email reply or app interface ("Accurate - I see the flood," "False Alarm," "Situation Resolved"). Data tagged in database for threshold refinement.
* **Admin Review Process**: Dedicated `/admin/feedback` page with filtering by parish, date, and feedback type
* **Real-time Map Integration**: Verified incident reports automatically appear as markers on public map
* **Trust Building**: Feedback analysis workflow provides transparency on alert accuracy and system improvements

### Admin management:
* Admins log in via **custom JWT authentication** (email/password stored in MySQL, hashed with bcrypt). Sessions tracked in MySQL with expiration timestamps.
* Can adjust settings per parish (e.g. what thresholds trigger alert), manage users, see latest alert logs, see map overlay of parishes with risk levels.
* **Audit Trail**: All admin actions logged with user ID, timestamp, and changes made.

## Data & Caching Strategy

### Caching Layer:
* **Public map/status data**: Cache for 10 minutes using **MySQL database** (no Redis in Students Starter)
* **Weather API responses**: Cache for 5 minutes in MySQL to minimize API calls
* **Parish boundary data**: Cache for 24 hours in MySQL (static data)

### Database Design Enhancements:
* **Users table**: Add audit fields (created_at, updated_at, last_login), accessibility_settings (text_to_speech, high_contrast, font_size), driver_mode_enabled (boolean), gps_tracking_consent (boolean)
* **Alerts table**: Include delivery_status, retry_count, error_logs, **flood_type** (flash/riverine/all_clear), **severity_level**, message_template_id, affected_roads (JSON array), message_tone ('calm', 'urgent', 'informational')
* **Incident_reports table**: Store crowdsourced flood reports with location (lat/lng), description, severity_level, photo_url, **verification_status** ('unverified', 'community_confirmed', 'odpem_verified'), **report_count** (for auto-escalation), reported_by_user_id, created_at, **escalated_at** (timestamp when 2+ reports trigger admin notification)
* **Alert_feedback table**: User responses to alerts (alert_id, user_id, feedback_type ('accurate', 'false_alarm', 'resolved'), comments, created_at)
* **Route_advisories table**: Store road status updates (road_name, parish, status ('passable', 'impassable', 'caution'), last_updated, verified_by_admin)
* **Recovery_resources table**: Post-flood assistance information (resource_type, provider_name, contact_info, parish, availability_status)
* **Radio_broadcasts table**: Track emergency radio partnerships (station_name, frequency, coverage_area, contact_info, backup_power_available)
* **Admin_actions table**: Log all administrative changes
* **Alert_history table**: Archive of all sent alerts for compliance, **with resolution timestamps and status updates**
* **Sessions table**: Store JWT sessions with expiration for admin auth
* **Retry_queue table**: Queue failed operations when database is temporarily unavailable
* **Cache_data table**: Store frequently accessed data (weather, parish boundaries) with TTL
* **Alert_templates table**: Store different message templates for flash flood vs riverine flood vs all-clear alerts vs motorist-specific warnings, **with tone guidelines** (calm vs urgent phrasing)
* **Emergency_shelters table**: Store shelter locations with name, address, lat/lng, capacity, contact_info for emergency locator feature

### File Storage & Configuration:
* **Parish boundary data**: Store as BLOB in MySQL or bundle with application
* **Static assets**: Serve from App Service wwwroot folder
* **Secrets Management**: Store all secrets in **App Service Configuration** (JWT signing keys, SMTP credentials, API keys)
* **Configuration**: Environment-specific settings in App Settings (no Azure Key Vault available)

## Deployment & Infrastructure
* Use **Resource Group(s)** to group related resources: one for frontend, one for backend, one for database. Tag resources for cost monitoring.
* Use **CI/CD**: build pipelines that deploy front-end and back-end automatically (Github Actions or Azure DevOps).
* Ensure proper configuration of Application Insights for all components (errors, latency).
* Logging & monitoring: set up alerts if functions fail, or if error rate above threshold.

## Scalability & Capacity Planning

### Target Capacity (Free Tier Limits):
* **Users**: Support up to 5,000 registered users (Target: 10,000 registrations in first year)
* **Concurrent Alerts**: Handle 100 simultaneous alert dispatches
* **API Calls**: Process 1,000 weather API calls per hour
* **Database**: 250MB MySQL storage limit
* **Function Executions**: 1M executions per month

### Critical Scaling Considerations:
* **"Victim of Success" Planning**: Proactive upgrade to paid tier before hitting 80% capacity during major weather events
* **Weather Data Quality Dependency**: System effectiveness tied to external API accuracy - false positives/negatives could erode community trust
* **Cache Duration Risk**: 2-hour weather cache may be too long for rapidly developing flash floods - consider reducing to 30 minutes for critical alerts
* **Data Integrity**: All weather data verified against Jamaica Met Service official sources, transparent audit logs public

### Resource Monitoring:
* Track MySQL storage usage (target <200MB)
* Monitor Function execution count (target <800K/month)
* Alert when approaching 80% of any free tier limit
* Auto-scale considerations: queue alerts during peak loads

## Cost / Capacity Planning under Starter Limits
* Identify free tier limits (e.g. number of MySQL in-app units, function invocations, storage quotas). Ensure usage stays under these.
* Plan for growth: have metrics/reporting for resource usage so you know when you hit limits.
* If usage > free tiers, decide fallback: degrade features (disable SMS, reduce check frequency), or upgrade plan.

## What Is Not Possible / Needs External or Upgrading Plan

**Services NOT Available in Students Starter:**
* **Azure AD B2C** - Must use custom authentication
* **Azure Redis Cache** - Must use MySQL for caching
* **Azure Communication Services (SMS)** - No SMS capability without external provider
* **SignalR Service** - Limited to Notification Hubs for push notifications
* **Azure SQL Database** - Only MySQL in-app available
* **Azure Storage Account** - Limited file storage options
* **Custom domains with SSL** - Must use *.azurewebsites.net domains
* **CDN or Traffic Manager** - No global distribution services
* **Azure Key Vault** - Must store secrets in App Settings
* **Azure Monitor beyond Application Insights** - Limited monitoring capabilities

**Available Services in Students Starter:**
* **Azure App Services** - Web app hosting
* **Azure Functions** - Serverless compute  
* **Notification Hubs** - Mobile push notifications
* **MySQL in-app** - Database with CMS support
* **Application Insights** - Performance and diagnostics telemetry
* **Azure DevOps** - CI/CD pipelines and collaboration tools

**External Dependencies Required:**
* **Weather Data**: Jamaica Meteorological Service API or other free weather APIs
* **Email Service**: Must use SMTP through App Services (limited daily quota)
* **SMS Alerts**: Would require external provider like Twilio (additional cost)
* **Maps**: Free mapping service like OpenStreetMap or Leaflet

## Error Handling & Resilience

### System Failure Scenarios:
* **Weather API Unavailable**: Use cached data (max 2 hours old), notify admin via email, display "Data may be delayed" message
* **Database Connection Lost**: Use **MySQL retry tables** to queue operations for 5 minutes, then fail gracefully with user notification
* **Email Service Down**: Automatically switch to **Notification Hubs push notifications** for all registered users
* **Function Timeout**: Split large alert batches into smaller chunks, implement Azure Function retry policies
* **Authentication Service Issues**: Provide read-only admin dashboard, disable write operations

### Monitoring & Alerting:
* Application Insights dashboards for all error types
* **Email alerts to admin** if error rate >5% over 15 minutes (no SMS available in Students Starter)
* **Email alerts to admin** if system completely down

## Acceptance Criteria
For AI / dev agent, tasks must meet:

1. **Public landing page** with map and flood status (map must render, data source must be wired with caching).
2. **Registration form** saving users in DB with error handling and confirmation.
3. **Alerting mechanism** that triggers based on parish thresholds; sends email + **Notification Hubs push notifications** as available channels.
4. **Admin login & dashboard**: secure via **custom JWT authentication**, can view/change thresholds, view users, with audit logging in MySQL.
5. **Monitoring**: Application Insights fully hooked, error logs shown, simple dashboard of errors and capacity metrics.
6. **Cost usage report**: Usage metrics on App Service, Functions, DB usage so you can see free tier margin.
7. **Error resilience**: System handles API failures gracefully, retries failed operations, and provides fallback data sources.
8. **Performance**: Public pages load in <3 seconds, admin operations complete in <5 seconds, alert dispatch completes in <30 seconds for 100 users.
