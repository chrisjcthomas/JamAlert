## Deployment Readiness

The admin dashboard frontend is fully implemented and ready for integration with the backend APIs. Key integration points:

1. **Authentication API**: `/api/auth/login` endpoint
2. **Dashboard API**: `/api/admin/dashboard` for statistics
3. **User Management API**: `/api/admin/users` for user operations
4. **Incident API**: `/api/admin/incidents` for incident management
5. **Alert API**: `/api/admin/alerts` for alert operations
6. **Audit API**: `/api/admin/audit` for audit logs

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real Azure Functions APIs
2. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket or polling for live data
3. **Enhanced Security**: Add CSRF protection and rate limiting
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement proper caching strategies
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage once React 19 compatibility is resolved

## Demo Access

The admin dashboard can be accessed at `/admin/login` with demo credentials:
- **Email**: admin@jamalert.jm
- **Password**: admin123

All admin functionality is fully operational with mock data for demonstration purposes.
